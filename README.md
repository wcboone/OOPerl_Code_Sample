# OOPerl_Code_Sample

This is a OOPerl code sample component that I had worked on, code enhanced, debugged and tested previously. This code was invoked by a shell wrapper or shell executable code to initiate the Object creations for a Data Feed process system application taking in XML data feed content files from different merchants. This system application component existed within a LINUX OS environment.
